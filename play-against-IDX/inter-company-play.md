#Inter Company Play

This is something IDX has wanted to do for some time.

The ideas a tech company in Eugene assembles thier crew (6 members) and rolls on over to IDX for soem space fun time.

IDX likely would have enough hardware to facilitate two teams.

If the visiting team has never played Artemis before an experianced player from IDX can join your team to help out.

The missions would be co op to start, then head to head battles can take place. Custom missions could also come into play.

Currently we have not set up a way to play outside our buiiling.

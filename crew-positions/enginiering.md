#Engineering

The role of engineering is controlling energy levels of the ship. Energy can be routed to front or rear shields, sensors, torpedos, primary beam, maneuvering, and warp (if not using jump).

The Engineerâ€™s Console displays a 3D schematic of your vessel showing current energy levels and assignments. Damage also is shown.

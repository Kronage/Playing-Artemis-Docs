#Helm

##Go over there:
Those at the helm will be asked repeatedly to go "over there". A heading is much more useful. The heading refers to the 360 degrees we see above. In the above image the ship has a heading of about 0. This will steer the ship to the top of the map in a tactical view. Clicking on any heading in the 360 degrees view will point the ship to the heading clicked on.

##Warp it up or Jump around:
Impulse power is the yellow slider on the left of the screen shot above. This will move the ship forward. Click Reverse to move the ship backwards with out turning around. This is useful to put some distance between you and an advancing ship. To get any place in a reasonable amount of time however, we need to move faster than light (warp) or fold space (jump).
Warp is the green slider and makes ship go fast fast. Like many aspects of the ship, Engineering can control the amount of ship energy dedicated to Warp. When at Warp, pressing the space bar will immediately bring you out of Warp. When at Impulse, space will bring you to all stop.

Jump relies on two coordinates to establish a point in space. This is a heading and a distance to Jump. This distance is limited by the amount of energy your ship has. In Jumping, remember you still have to get back. Helm can always have a short Jump programmed in. Sometimes it doesn't matter where you go, as long as it's "away".
 
Either method requires energy management or you will be stuck floating in space out of gas for the ship. Think ahead and advise the Cap'n on energy.
Pew Pew pew:
Helm and Weapons will need to communicate during battles. Positioning for Attack, keeping your distance for the "safe" use of Nukes, and keeping targets at the front of the ship are some common communications. Engineering should also be very involved. Energy from Helm's Steering/Warp to Weapons/Shields, ships go boom, and energy back to Helm is a common scenario. As Helm keep an eye on the shields going into battle. Many in the crew can turn them on, but it's easily forgotten for some reason.
 
##Docking:
Docking to a space station is needed to gain energy and weapons. It is almost always a good idea and likely should be done even with out Captain orders. To dock click the Request Dock button on the left of the screen(see screen shot above). To undock simply move under impulse power.
 
##Up Up Down Down:
The Neutral Up and Down arrows moves the ship along a Y axis. While space is 3D it doesn't appear to much of a factor in this game and can be ignored for the most part.
Left Right Left Right:
The slider at the bottom turns the ship left or right. If used Helm will need to correct the left turn by returning the slider to 0 or the ship will continue to turn in the direction indicated.

#Captain

The role of the captain is to command the ship. This player does not get a device to work with, but instead must depend on verbal communication with the rest of the crew and the shared main view screen.

The Captain must engage all of the crew and keep the mission in mind. As the leader all crew members must keep the Captain updated on the ship status.

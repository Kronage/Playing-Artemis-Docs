At IDX we play the Star Trek simulator game Artemis as a team building exercise. This game is perfect for this as players must speak commands and reports out loud. In short to even play you must communicate with your team.

## Basic Concept of the game
If you have ever seen Star Trek, you will recognize the set up. 

The crew consists of 

* Captain - Monarch of the stars

* Helm - Steer the ship

* Weapons - Pew Pew Pew

* Engineering - Monitor the ships systems and direct energy

* Communications - Curse at other ships and make weapons requests to bases

* Science - Scan the whole verse

* Game Master - Place Humanity on trial


There is one main screen all players see. The Captian sees only the main screen. Each player will man a station and perform their duties on their own screens. Players can not see the screens of the rest of the crew's stations so verbal communication is used to work together. Team building!

##Required

* Windows or win emulation like WINE or a Virtual Machine.

* One machine as server connected to a large screen for all the crew to see.

* Devices for the rest of the crew. This can be laptops, desktops, tablets, or even phones.

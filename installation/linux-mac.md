# Linux or Mac

The game must be run in emulation or a VM. There is no Mac or Linux version available or planned.

Depending on your VM set up you might encounter a network issue.

This game does run just fine in WINE.

##Mac

If you have not installed WINE before, here is a great article on it for Mac: https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/wine-mac/

This has been tested and worked great on a MacBook Air.

On MacBook Pro this did not run successfully.

Of course with Bootcamp you can just boot into Windows. This has been tested and works great.

##Linux

# Installation

Installing on Windows is very straight forward.

Download from http://artemis.eochu.com/index.php/downloads/

and install as normal for Windows.

The game is very light and has been tested on versions as far back as XP SP2.

This was also tested on Win 7 and Win 10.

Not tested on Vista or ME as everyone should pretend those didn't happen.
